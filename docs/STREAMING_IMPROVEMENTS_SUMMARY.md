# Streaming Implementation Improvements Summary

## What Was Improved

1. **Character-by-Character Streaming Output**:
   - Modified the `AbstractModelClient` to provide true逐字流输出 (character-by-character streaming)
   - Added a new `streamRequest` method that handles the streaming logic
   - Updated both `DeepSeekClient` and `QwenClient` to use the improved streaming implementation

2. **Better Generator Implementation**:
   - The streaming now yields individual characters instead of larger chunks
   - This provides a more granular and realistic streaming experience
   - Proper UTF-8 character handling for international text

3. **Code Reusability**:
   - Moved common streaming logic to the abstract parent class
   - Both concrete clients now reuse the same streaming implementation
   - Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability

## Key Changes

### AbstractModelClient.php
- Added `streamRequest` method that handles character-by-character streaming
- Proper UTF-8 character handling using `mb_strlen` and `mb_substr`
- Improved error handling and resource management

### DeepSeekClient.php and QwenClient.php
- Simplified `streamChatComplete` methods to use the parent's `streamRequest` method
- Removed duplicated streaming logic
- Maintained the same interface while improving the implementation

## Benefits of the Improvements

1. **Better User Experience**:
   - True character-by-character streaming provides a more natural typing effect
   - Users can see the response being generated in real-time, character by character

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - More efficient streaming with better resource management
   - Reduced memory usage by not buffering large chunks

3. **Enhanced Compatibility**:
   - Proper UTF-8 character handling ensures international text is streamed correctly
   - Works with emojis and other Unicode characters

4. **Maintainability**:
   - Centralized streaming logic reduces code duplication
   - Easier to maintain and update streaming functionality

## Testing

The improvements have been tested with:
- Model factory creation
- Streaming with both DeepSeek and Qwen clients
- Character counting and performance metrics
- UTF-8 character handling

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating that the improved streaming implementation works correctly.

## Usage

The streaming implementation can be used exactly as before:

```php
foreach ($client->streamChatComplete($messages) as $character) {
    echo $character;
    flush(); // Flush output to see streaming in real-time
}
```

The only difference is that now each yielded value is a single character instead of a larger chunk, providing a smoother streaming experience.
