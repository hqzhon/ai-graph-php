# Code Cleanup Summary

## What was accomplished

1. **Removed duplicated implementations**:
   - Removed the old `src/Graph` directory
   - Removed the old `src/LangGraph` directory
   - Kept only the unified implementation in `src/UnifiedGraph`

2. **Updated all references**:
   - Updated agent components to use the unified `State` class instead of `GraphState`
   - Updated workflow examples to use the unified graph implementation
   - Updated service classes to use the unified implementation
   - Updated test files to use the unified implementation

3. **Cleaned up test files**:
   - Removed old test files that referenced the deprecated implementations
   - Updated existing test files to use the unified implementation
   - Created new test files for the unified implementation

4. **Maintained functionality**:
   - All existing functionality is preserved
   - Agent system continues to work as expected
   - Workflow engine works with the unified implementation
   - All tests pass successfully

## Benefits of the cleanup

1. **Reduced code duplication**: Eliminated two separate implementations of similar functionality
2. **Simplified maintenance**: Only one implementation to maintain instead of three
3. **Improved consistency**: All components now use the same underlying graph implementation
4. **Enhanced flexibility**: The unified implementation supports both callable functions and object-based nodes
5. **Better code organization**: Cleaner directory structure with only necessary components

## Files removed

- `src/Graph/` directory and all its contents
- `src/LangGraph/` directory and all its contents
- `bin/test-graph.php`
- `bin/test-langgraph.php`

## Files updated

- All agent components in `src/Agent/`
- All workflow examples in `src/Agent/Example/`
- Service classes in `src/Service/`
- Test files in `bin/`

## Files added

- New test files for the unified implementation
- Updated documentation in README.md

The codebase is now much cleaner and easier to maintain, with all graph-based functionality consolidated into a single, unified implementation.
