# Refactoring Summary: Unified Graph Implementation

## Problem Statement
The project had two separate implementations of graph-based workflow systems:
1. `src/LangGraph` - An implementation similar to the Python LangGraph library
2. `src/Graph` - A more traditional object-oriented workflow implementation

These implementations had significant overlap in functionality but were developed separately, leading to code duplication and maintenance challenges.

## Solution Implemented
We created a unified implementation in `src/UnifiedGraph` that combines the best features of both approaches:

### Key Features of the Unified Implementation

1. **Flexible Node Types**:
   - Supports callable functions (LangGraph style)
   - Supports Node objects implementing NodeInterface (Graph style)
   - Allows mixing both types in a single workflow

2. **Unified State Management**:
   - Single StateInterface and State implementation
   - Works with both node types
   - Provides all necessary state operations

3. **Enhanced Edge System**:
   - EdgeInterface with condition support
   - Works with both execution models

4. **Dual Execution Models**:
   - CompiledGraph approach (LangGraph style) with streaming support
   - Executor approach (Graph style) with cycle detection

5. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing examples continue to work without modification
   - No breaking changes to existing APIs

### Components Eliminating Duplication

1. **State Management**:
   - Before: Separate implementations in `App\Graph\State` and `App\LangGraph\State`
   - After: Single implementation in `App\UnifiedGraph\State`

2. **Node Representation**:
   - Before: Callable functions in LangGraph vs Node objects in Graph
   - After: Unified approach supporting both with CallableNode adapter

3. **Edge Management**:
   - Before: Separate Edge implementations
   - After: Unified EdgeInterface and Edge implementation

4. **Workflow Execution**:
   - Before: Two separate execution models
   - After: Unified approach with both models available

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated overlapping functionality between the two implementations
2. **Enhanced Flexibility**: Developers can choose the approach that best fits their needs or mix both
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Single codebase to maintain for core functionality
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes
5. **Extensibility**: New features can be added to the unified implementation

## Migration Path

Existing code using either approach can be easily migrated to the unified implementation:

1. **LangGraph-style code**: Minimal changes required, mostly namespace updates
2. **Graph-style code**: Minimal changes required, mostly namespace updates
3. **Mixed approach**: New capability only available in unified implementation

## Testing

All existing examples were tested and continue to work correctly:
- `App\Graph\Example\SimpleWorkflow`
- `App\LangGraph\Example\ExampleWorkflow`

New unified examples were also created and tested:
- `App\UnifiedGraph\Example\ExampleWorkflow` (LangGraph style)
- `App\UnifiedGraph\Example\SimpleWorkflow` (Graph style)
- `App\UnifiedGraph\Example\MixedWorkflow` (Mixed approach)

## Conclusion

The unified graph implementation successfully eliminates duplication while preserving all existing functionality and adding new capabilities. It provides a single, flexible foundation for building graph-based workflows that can accommodate different programming styles and requirements.
