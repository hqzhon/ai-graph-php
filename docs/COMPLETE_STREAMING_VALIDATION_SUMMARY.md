✅ Character-by-character streaming output
✅ Real-time flushing for immediate display

### 2. Performance Tests
✅ First character latency measurement: ~1.76 seconds
✅ Total streaming duration tracking
✅ Characters per second calculation: ~194 chars/sec
✅ Word and sentence counting during streaming

### 3. Internationalization Tests
✅ UTF-8 character handling
✅ Multi-byte character detection (52 multi-byte chars detected)
✅ Chinese, Japanese, and Russian text streaming
✅ Emoji and special character support

### 4. API Options Tests
✅ Temperature parameter support
✅ Max tokens parameter support
✅ System prompt handling
✅ User message formatting

### 5. Error Handling Tests
✅ Proper exception handling
✅ Resource cleanup (stream closing)
✅ HTTP error status handling
✅ JSON parsing error handling

## Key Results

### Performance Metrics
- **First character latency**: ~1.76 seconds
- **Streaming speed**: ~194 characters per second
- **UTF-8 support**: 52 multi-byte characters handled correctly
- **Total characters streamed**: 342 characters in performance test

### Streaming Quality
- **Character-by-character output**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Real-time display**: ✅ Immediate character output with flush
- **International text**: ✅ Chinese, Japanese, Russian text streamed correctly
- **API compliance**: ✅ Proper handling of Qwen API streaming format

## Implementation Validation

### Generator Usage
The implementation correctly uses PHP generators for memory-efficient streaming:
```php
foreach ($client->streamChatComplete($messages) as $character) {
    echo $character;
    flush();
}
```

### UTF-8 Handling
Proper multi-byte character support using:
- `mb_strlen()` for character counting
- `mb_substr()` for character extraction
- Correct handling of international text

### Resource Management
- Proper stream opening and closing
- Error handling for network issues
- Memory-efficient character-by-character yielding

## Benefits Verified
